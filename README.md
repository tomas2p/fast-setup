# Fast-Setup

Fast-Setup is a tool designed to simplify project setup by automatically generating directory and file structures based on predefined configurations.

This project includes three main versions, each implemented differently to explore various technologies and approaches. Below is an overview of each version with links to their respective READMEs for more details.

## Versions

### 1. Bash Script

This version uses a Bash script to create project structures. It is ideal for Unix/Linux environments and for those who prefer simple shell scripting solutions.

### 2. Python with JSON

This version leverages Python with a JSON configuration file. It provides a more robust and extensible solution, allowing easy customization of project structure templates.
